Sizes:
Local array = 10^7  (size_t)
Global array = 10^8

Approximately,
(INT_MIN) -10^9< int < 10^9 (INT_MAX)
(LONG_MIN) -10^12< long < 10^12 (LONG_MAX)
(LLONG_MIN) -10^18< long long < 10^18 (LLONG_MAX)
Similarly, FLT_MIN, DBL_MIN, FLT_MAX and DBL_MAX

Types of Binary Tree:

On the basis of number of children:-
1) Full Binary Tree: 0 or 2 child
2) Degenerate Binary Tree: 0 or 1 child
3) Skewed Binary Tree: Degenerate Binary Tree which is dominated by left nodes (for left skewed) or right nodes (for right skewed).

On the basis of completion of levels:-
1) Perfect Binary Tree: Every level filled
2) Complete Binary Tree: Every level filled except last level where keys are as left as possible
3) Balanced Binary Tree: |Left Sub Tree- Right Sub Tree| <= 1

Special Trees:-
1) Binary Search Tree: Left subtree of each node contains keys lesser and right contains keys more than the node
2) AVL: Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree
3) Red Black Tree: Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree
4) B Tree
5) B+ Tree
6) Segment Tree
7) Heap Tree (Min heap and max heap)
