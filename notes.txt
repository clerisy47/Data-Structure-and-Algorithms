Sizes:
Local array = 10^7  (size_t)
Global array = 10^8
Aprroximately,
-10^9< int < 10^9 (INT_MAX)
-10^12< int < 10^12
-10^18< int < 10^8

Types of Binary Tree:

On the basis of number of children:-
1) Full Binary Tree: 0 or 2 child
2) Degenerate Binary Tree: 0 or 1 child
3) Skewed Binary Tree: Degenerate Binary Tree which is dominated by left nodes (for left skewed) or right nodes (for right skewed).

On the basis of completion of levels:-
1) Perfect Binary Tree: Every level filled
2) Complete Binary Tree: Every level filled except last level where keys are as left as possible
3) Balanced Binary Tree: |Left Sub Tree- Right Sub Tree| <= 1

Special Trees:-
1) Binary Search Tree: Left subtree of each node contains keys lesser and right contains keys more than the node
2) AVL: Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree
3) Red Black Tree: Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree
4) B Tree
5) B+ Tree
6) Segment Tree
7) Heap Tree (Min heap and max heap)
